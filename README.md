## Installation

You'll need [Deno](https://deno.com/):

```sh
brew install deno
```

You can then run the scripts by either cloning the repository and running them locally, or running them from the corresponding raw file URL from GitHub directly.

## Usage

### Character counting

```sh
deno run --allow-env char-count-ignoring-whitespace.ts <search-string> <text>
```

Finds all instances of `search-string` in `text` and prints the corresponding character range as it would be specified in the destination of an amending command in LDML.de. Whitespace in both the search string and the text is trimmed and consecutive spaces are replaced by a single space.
